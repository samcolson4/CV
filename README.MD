# Sam Colson
# Full Stack Software Developer

I decided to change careers and become a developer to be part of a team building something new, shaping a product that ultimately makes a genuine difference to peoples' lives.

I recently completed a three month Makers Bootcamp where I taught myself Ruby, JavaScript and Swift by building a range of applications and websites. In my previous roles, I always pushed myself to learn more and to take ownership in as many areas as possible. I want to bring this attitude and my experience from Makers to my next role, building an outstanding product with clean, well-tested code, whilst continuing to develop my own engineering skills.

## Skills
#### Teamwork
I have always enjoyed working as part of a diverse team to achieve a shared objective. During my time as a freelancer working for a crowdfunding start-up, a key goal was joining up the non-technical founder with the development team, ensuring that his requests were translated properly into functional requirements, and that the engineers working on the site were building it in a way that allowed us to scale quickly. Bringing these two sides of the business together to work as one team meant that the finished product fulfils all of the specifications that we began the business with, and has serviced thousands of users in the short time it has been live.

#### Innovation
I am always looking for new ways of working and how best to improve a business's offering. At the CBI, I:
- Developed a new stakeholder database to ensure meetings and engagement across a large, multi-region organisation was kept in check.
- Used readership and click-through metrics to inform changes being made to communications products.
- Evolved the organisation's communication with membership by increasing the use of data, translating complicated ideas into straightforward messages.

#### Problem solving
During my time at Makers, I considerably improved my problem solving skills. One example of this is my ability to trace errors in code, looking diligently through logs and error messages to find the issue. Employing a strategy of getting visibility and making the loop and smaller as I problem solve also enables me to track down niche and difficult bugs, understanding the program as a whole, rather than just an individual piece. I put this into practice on all of my projects, but particularly those that rely on reaching out to databases or APIs, where external data can sometimes cause unforeseen issues.
